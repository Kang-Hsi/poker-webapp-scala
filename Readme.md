### Description

Our poker web app adheres to the standard rules of Texas Hold’em Poker with very slight differences (i.e no straddles).

The UI displays the following: the dealer, small blind, big blind, with the amount of the blinds; all the players’ names with their balance and total bet amount, the current player will be in bold; the action taken by the current player and the remaining hands of the game; the communal cards (aka the cards in the middle) and the pot size; the player’s personal hand and his balance; the actions that the player can take; a log with all the actions that happening.


### Playing instructions

To start a game of poker simply enter the names of the playing players (has to be at least 3 players).
Join the game by selecting your name, and send the link to the other players.

You will then have a simple UI, displaying all the information needed for a simple game of Texas Hold'em Poker. To play, when it's your turn, you can act by pressing the buttons: fold, check/call and raise (by a given entered amount).
